Current Classes - Banker, Cash, Die, Player, Property
To be added (excluding GUI) - Board, Jail, OptionCards?(name to be changed), Utlities.

Potentially more to be added depending on the structure of Board.

Board will be the main bulky class, which includes all initialization for the propterty prices.
Banker is a simple class for the banker, this will include automation at some point.
Player is a simple class for the player.
Die is a class that generates a dice roll, and checks for doubles at the same time.
Property will hold rent prices, is this property owned/who it is owned, and the inital cost of purchasing the property.
Cash is a simple class to reduce redundency when using cash values.

Each specific type of 'board' type will have its own class, such as properties, utilities, free pass, the random chance (not sure on the name yet) etc.
This will use when coming to design the squares other than properties, which has not been done yet.
